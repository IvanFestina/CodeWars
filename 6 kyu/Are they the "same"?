//Given two arrays a and b write a function comp(a, b) (orcompSame(a, b)) that checks whether the two arrays have the "same" elements, with the same multiplicities (the multiplicity of a member is the number of times it appears). "Same" means, here, that the elements in b are the elements in a squared, regardless of the order.

function comp(array1, array2){
 if(array1.length !== array2.length) return false
  return array1.map(x => x * x).sort().toString === array2.sort().toString
}

console.log(comp([121, 144, 19, 161, 19, 144, 19, 11], [11*11, 121*121, 144*144, 19*19, 161*161, 19*19, 144*144, 19*19]))
