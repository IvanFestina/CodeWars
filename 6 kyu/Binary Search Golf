This kata is a code golf, so the object is to solve the problem in as few characters as possible.

Createa function z that given the length l of a 1-dimensional sorted array, returns the maximum iterations it will take to find any value in the array using a binary search.

Your function must be <= 100 characters.
The majority of the Math object is missing, so your answer shouldn't count on it
You do not need to validate input -- l will always be >= 1
Characters includes the function keyword, parameters, brackets, return keyword, whitespace, etc. Essentially the character count is every character in your function.

Above your solution, place a comment that gives the character count for your function so we can more easily see who has the shortest answer.

Your code will likely be very confusing, so if you have the time, comment on your own solution and explain it.

z(1) //returns 1
z(2) //returns 2
z(4) //returns 3
z(999) //returns 10
z(1000) //returns 10



const z(l,r=1) =>l<=1?r:z(l/2-l%1,r+1)
